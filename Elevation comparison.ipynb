    "## Elevation\n",
    "We investigated the agreement between WV Breeding Bird Atlas (2011-2015) and USGS Gap Analysis Project data on the elevational limits in occurrence.\n",
    "\n",
    "We compared three things: the elevations of survey locations where individuals were recorded by the WVBBA, the maximum and minimum elevations of habitat grid cells as mapped by GAP for each species, and the elevation parameter values from GAP habitat models.  We obtained WVBBA data from WV biologists who ran that project.  We determined the maximum and minimum elevations of habitat grid cells by summarizing their elevations with the arcpy package (\"map_max\" and \"map_min\").  Habitat model parameters were retrieved from ScienceBase items for the models.  The border between GAP's southeastern and northeastern modeling regions passes through WV, so habitat maps within WV could potentially have been produced in part from different sets of parameters.  We therefore used southeastern and northeastern model parameters in our comparisons (\"NE_max\", \"NE_min\", \"SE_max\", and \"SE_min\"), which, in some cases, complicated comparisons.\n",
    "\n",
    "To quantify the agreement between data sets, we tallied the number of individuals that the WVBBA recorded above and below the max elevations from habitat maps (\"individuals_over(n)\" and \"individuals_under(n)\"), as well as the differences between maximum and minimum elevations from WVBBA surveys and GAP maps (\"max_diff\" and \"min_diff\").

    "A complication existed regarding the elevations of WVBBA survey data that necessitated specifying an allowable difference between elevation values below which values are considered equal.  That is because observers used a point count protocol in which bird detections were attributed to the survey point.  Although the survey location was recorded as a point, the area surveyed was actually a polygon approximating a circle.  Thus, birds could have been detected from within a range of elevations despite being attributed to a point.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The range of elevations surveyed in a point count is determined by the width of the circle that was effectively surveyed and the terrain around the point.  The distance from the observer's location (i.e. the point) at which individuals could have been detected, which ultimately determines the width of the circle, is affected by site characteristics including vegetation structure.  Thus, the elevation ranges assocated with detections varies among points.  If the survey area was large and the terrain steep, then the range of elevations at which birds could have been detected is large.  Without knowing the conditions at each survey location, it is impossible to precisely attribute each record to an elevation, but ignoring this issue would introduce error in our assessment, therefore we approximated an allowable margin of error of 75m for elevation values that we used when comparing WVBBA records to GAP data: values were considered equal when they were within 75m of each other.  We chose 75m because individuals can often be heard from distance of 100m or more in auditory bird surveys and WV, in general, is mountainous."

    "### Which models have innapropriate GAP elevation parameters that should be adjusted for WV?\n",
    "Cases where the elevation parameter should be adjusted can be identified by determining which species were detected in significant frequency at elevations above the maximum or below the minimum elevation predicted with the habitat map *and* for which a map elevation extreme equals the corresponding elevation parameter in the model.  Equivalent elevation limits from the maps and models indicate that a model's elevation limits restricted model output (the map).  It is possible for the elevation parameter to differ from the map extremes when other model parameters, such as cover type selections, restrict output to elevations that are higher than the minimum or lower than the maximum.  Defining a \"significant frequency\" of WVBBA occurrences that defy the model parameter is subjective, but we used a value of 1% of total detections.  Additionally, we applied the margin of error discussed above so that at least one detection had to be more than 75m above the GAP maximum or below the minimum in order for frequency of errors to be assessed.

    "## Conclusions\n",
    "It was possible to identify ways to improve the GAP habitat models with data from the WVBBA.  Additionally, merely comparing the GAP data to itself (i.e. model parameters to the output maps) revealed some areas for improvement.  The results above identify those specific changes that should be made to models.  However, they also reveal an aspect of the modeling paradigm that limits model quality and iterative improvement.  Using the six large, modeling regions means that models cannot be parameterized or refined locally even when knowledge is available to warrant it. Modelers have to assign parameters that can accomodate all the environments where a species could occur throughout the modeling region, even if tolerable environments exist along a gradients. In the case of elevation, an obsolete parameter within WV may be justified due to suitable environments in ME and any changes made to models for WV will affect habitat predictions from ME to FL, LA, and AR.  Additionally, the habitat associations (e.g., elevational limits) of species may vary across such broad regions.  In order to  incorporate state-level data into model improvements without reducing their specificity, it will be necessary to accomodate smaller and/or customized modeling regions."
