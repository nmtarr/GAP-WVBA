    "#  US Gap Analysis Project - WV Breeding Bird Atlas Data Comparison \n",
    "Nathan Tarr and Jessie Jordan\n",
    "USGS NC Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit\n",
    "North Carolina State University\n",
    "Raleigh, NC\n",
    "\n",
    "We investigated the agreement between WV Breeding Bird Atlas (2011-2015) and USGS Gap Analysis Project data on the species occupying West Virginia.  We also investigated the species that were reported to eBird between 2011 and 2015.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Results\n",
    "\n",
    " - The data suggest that the WVBBA did not detect some species that breed in WV, but only a couple.\n",
    " - Only two species were reported to eBird that were neither detected by the WVBBA nor predicted to breed in WV by GAP.\n",
    " - WVBBA did not detect any species that were not submitted to eBird or predicted to be present in the state by GAP.\n",
    " - The WVBBA detected three species that GAP predicted were absent from the state.\n",
    " - GAP predicted that some species breed in WV for which no records turned up in the WVBBA data or eBird: Lark Sparrow, Bewick's Wren, and King Rail.  Making this comparison without considering eBird data, the list was five species long.\n",
    " - WVBBA detected 28 species in insufficient quantities for modeling.  Among the list were several wetland and nocturnal species as well as rare and sparsely distributed species.\n",
    " \n",
    "## Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "- Our comparisons suggest that whereas the WVBBA detected nearly every species that breeds within WV, several species were detected in insufficient quantities to produce abundance and distribution maps.  Survey effort may have been insufficient in wetlands, at high elevations, and at night.\n",
    "- GAP's season designations, \"winter\" and \"summer\", are valuable because they could support efforts to identify vagrants and late-migrants from species lists.  However, they are not explicitly defined with boundary dates (start and end weeks), and therefore, the appropriateness of such judgements (observation records vs. range data) is questionable and uncertain in many cases."

    "## Methods\n",
    "This document demonstrates a comparison of three species lists:\n",
    "\n",
    "__Gap Analysis Project__ -- we queried the GAP range data to retrieve a list of species that GAP predicts occur within WV during summer or winter.\n",
    "\n",
    "__WVBBA__ -- we summarized the species detected during WVBBA point count surveys and other efforts to collect data.\n",
    "\n",
    "__eBird__ -- we pulled a list of species, and the frequency of detection from the eBird API via the R \"rebird package\" for May and June of the years from 2011 to 2015.  The table returned had the following columns for WV during the months of May and June and years 2011 to 2015:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"monthQt\": month and week (a four week period)\n",
    "\n",
    "\"comName\": species common name\n",
    "\n",
    "\"frequency\": proportion of times the species was seen in a\n",
    "specified week\n",
    "\n",
    "\"sampleSize\" number of complete eBird checklists submitted for\n",
    "specified given week.\n",
    "\n",
    "We aggregated weekly mean frequencies of detection to a single value by calculating their mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "### WVBBA and GAP\n",
    "We combined a list of species that GAP predicted to be in WV with the WVBBA data by linking records on common names.  We manually resolved unmatched names due to typographical differences, although very few existed."
